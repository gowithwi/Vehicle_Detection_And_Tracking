    "\n",
    "* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier\n",
    "* Apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. \n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* Run the pipeline on a video stream and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.\n",

    "\n",
    "I decided to search windows with the size dependent on the position, so that I can skip the smaller sized windows on the unnecessary parts of the image (more close to camera, supposed to have bigger sized window for car). \n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "### Video Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)\n",
    "The video is uploaded to the github.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    stored_heat.append(heat)\n",
    "    sum_heat = []\n",
    "    sum_heat = heat * 0\n",
    "    for jj in range(len(stored_heat)):\n",
    "        sum_heat = sum_heat + stored_heat[jj]\n",
    "    heat = sum_heat/len(stored_heat)\n",
    "    heat = apply_threshold(heat,1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example result showing the bounded boxes of car. I used the averaged heat map over the last 5 frames to further reduce the false positive detection, as below.\n",

    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still some noise, false positives in the image, but the results are much better now with the two methods I implanted-- lower C factor in classifier training, and averaged heatmap.\n"
